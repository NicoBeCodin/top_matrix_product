# Introduction

This document reports on the performance of a naive matrix multiplication using [Kokkos](https://kokkos.org/) in C++. We explore both **runtime** and **GFLOP/s**, conduct a **strong scaling study**, and compare two data layouts: **`LayoutLeft`** vs **`LayoutRight`**.

###
```cpp
template <class AMatrixType, class BMatrixType, class CMatrixType>
auto matrix_product(double alpha, AMatrixType const& A, BMatrixType const& B, double beta, CMatrixType& C) -> void {
  static_assert(
    AMatrixType::rank() == 2 && BMatrixType::rank() == 2 && CMatrixType::rank() == 2, "Views must be of rank 2"
  );
  assert(A.extent(0) == C.extent(0));
  assert(B.extent(1) == C.extent(1));
  assert(A.extent(1) == B.extent(0));

  Kokkos::parallel_for(
    "dgemm_kernel",
    A.extent(0),
    KOKKOS_LAMBDA(int i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < int(B.extent(1)); ++j) {
        double acc = 0.0;
        for (int k = 0; k < int(A.extent(1)); ++k) {
          acc += alpha * A(i, k) * B(k, j);
        }
        C(i, j) *= beta + acc;
      }
    }
  );
}
```

## 1. Measuring Performance for the naive matrix product
We run `strong_scaling.py` for the following tests.
We measure three primary metrics:

- **Runtime (s)**: Wall-clock time for the entire multiplication.
- **GFLOP/s =** 
 2 * M * N * K * 10⁹
- **Speedup**: Runtime gains achieved relative to thread count

## **Strong Scaling Results**

## **Analysis of Kokkos Layout Performance**

### **Layout Comparison**

The observed results clearly demonstrate a difference in performance between the two memory layouts used by Kokkos:

- **`Kokkos::LayoutLeft`** consistently outperforms **`Kokkos::LayoutRight`** in every tested configuration. The advantage is especially clear at lower thread counts, e.g., at a single thread (`1.61` vs. `1.45 GFLOP/s`) and at two threads (`3.08` vs. `2.73 GFLOP/s`).
- At higher thread counts (4 and 8 threads), LayoutLeft continues to outperform LayoutRight, achieving a higher peak performance (`5.83 GFLOP/s` for LayoutLeft vs. `5.23 GFLOP/s` for LayoutRight).

### **Reasons for Performance Difference**

The difference in performance arises from the underlying memory access patterns:

- **`Kokkos::LayoutLeft`** is column-major, meaning consecutive memory elements in a column are stored contiguously. This layout typically benefits CPU cache performance when accessing elements column-wise, as is commonly done in optimized matrix multiplications.
- **`Kokkos::LayoutRight`** is row-major (the default C++ array layout), which arranges consecutive elements of a row contiguously. While intuitive in typical C++ contexts, it can lead to less efficient memory access patterns for certain linear algebra operations.

Due to better alignment with memory access patterns in the matrix multiplication kernel, LayoutLeft achieves better cache utilization, significantly reducing cache misses and thus improving performance.


##  **Strong Scaling Analysis**

### **Runtime**

- For **LayoutLeft**, runtime initially scales very well from 1 to 4 threads (`1.24s` → `0.34s`). However, adding more threads (from 4 to 8) worsens the runtime (`0.34s` → `0.53s`), indicating that optimal parallel efficiency is reached at 4 threads.
- For **LayoutRight**, the trend is similar: runtime improves significantly from 1 to 4 threads (`1.38s` → `0.38s`), and then degrades at 8 threads (`0.38s` → `0.55s`).

### **GFLOP/s**

- **Ideal scaling** (doubling threads doubles performance) occurs from 1 to 2 threads in both layouts, and nearly ideal from 2 to 4 threads.
- At 8 threads, both configurations exhibit a significant decrease in performance, strongly suggesting thread contention or that hyper-threading is not beneficial for the tested kernel.

### **Speedup**

- **LayoutLeft** achieves near-ideal linear speedup from 1 to 4 threads, with a maximum speedup of ~3.6x.
- **LayoutRight** also shows near-linear scaling up to 4 threads but with slightly lower peak efficiency (~3.6x speedup).
- At 8 threads, efficiency drops significantly for both layouts.


## **Conclusion**

The optimal configuration identified through this analysis is clearly **`Kokkos::LayoutLeft` at 4 threads**, yielding the highest performance and most effective memory utilization. Running the matrix product with 8 threads results in a performance drop, this indicates potential resource contention or hyper-threading inefficiencies beyond the number of physical CPU cores available (which are typically 4 physical cores for an Intel Core i5-1035G1) Future optimizations might focus on mitigating thread contention and optimizing cache usage further at higher thread counts.

# Part 2: Cache Blocking
All runs are now done on the `LayoutLeft` version of the code, `OMP_PLACES="cores"`,`OMP_PROC_BIND=true`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=4` if not specified otherwise.

## Q1 Perf profiling
### Quick Introduction to the Perf Tool

`perf` is a powerful Linux profiling tool used to analyze performance aspects of software, particularly CPU performance. It accesses CPU hardware counters that measure various events, such as:

- **Cache usage** (hits and misses at different cache levels).
- **Branch predictions** (correct/incorrect predictions).
- **Instructions executed**, cycles consumed, and more.

### **Key points about `perf`:**
- **Hardware Counters**: `perf` uses built-in CPU performance counters to track events.
- **Events**: You can monitor specific events (`cache-misses`, `cache-references`, `L1-dcache-loads`, etc.).
- **Overhead**: `perf` incurs minimal performance overhead, making it suitable for production-level profiling.


## Analysis of `perf` Results

We run the following command:

```shell
perf stat -e L1-dcache-loads,L1-dcache-load-misses,LLC-loads,LLC-load-misses \
./top.matrix_product 1000 1000 1000
```



| Metric                  | Value                      | Interpretation                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Runtime**             | `0.365 s`                  | Reasonable overall performance              |
| **Performance**         | `5.48 GFLOP/s`             | Moderate computational throughput           |
| **L1 Cache Loads**  | `1,599,912,257`       |  |
| **L1 Cache Missses**  | `1,156,202,708`       | |       |  |
| **L1 Cache Miss Rate**  | `72.27%` (very high)       | Poor L1 cache locality; memory access issues |
| **LLC Cache loads**       | `5,374,711`       |  |
| **LLC Cache misses**       | `3,858,748` | |
| **LLC Miss Rate**       | `71.79%` (very high)       | Poor LLC reuse; large memory-bound penalty  |


### **2. Cache Performance Analysis**

####  **L1 Cache Analysis:**
This is a very high L1 miss rate (ideally should be much lower, typically below 5-10%). This means about **3 out of every 4 memory accesses miss the fastest cache (L1)**, resulting in higher latency accesses and significantly impacting performance.

This is typically due to:
- Poor memory access patterns (e.g., not exploiting spatial locality).
- Large working sets not fitting within the small L1 cache (only 48 KiB per core in your CPU).

####  **Last-Level Cache (LLC/L3) Analysis:**
This is also a **high LLC miss rate**, meaning when data misses in L1 and then eventually misses in the LLC, it must fetch data directly from main memory (RAM), significantly increasing latency.

High LLC miss rates typically indicate:
- Data access patterns that exceed the cache size (your CPU's LLC is 6 MiB).
- Insufficient data reuse (low temporal locality).

##  **Interpretation**

The provided `perf` results highlight clear performance bottlenecks in memory access:

- **High L1 Miss Rate**:  
  - Suggests the blocked or loop-ordered matrix multiplication is not optimized for spatial locality, causing frequent misses even at the fastest cache level.
  - This typically occurs if loops access memory inefficiently (e.g., accessing matrices in a sub-optimal pattern, like accessing columns instead of rows, depending on memory layout).

- **High LLC Miss Rate**:  
  - Indicates the working set of your problem does not fit within the CPU's largest cache (L3 cache).
  - Frequent misses at this level dramatically slow performance because memory fetches must occur from main memory, typically ~100 times slower than L1 cache accesses.


## Q2 Implementing a cache blocked version 


To significantly enhance the performance of the naive matrix multiplication, I implemented a cache-blocked version of the algorithm. The goal of this approach is to improve both spatial and temporal data locality, reducing cache misses and thus increasing computational efficiency.

### Cache-blocked Implementation

The provided cache-blocked function splits matrices into smaller sub-blocks defined by block sizes `BM`, `BN`, and `BK`. These sub-blocks are specifically chosen to fit within the CPU cache hierarchy (primarily L1 and L3 caches). Each sub-block of matrices A, B, and C is loaded into local arrays (`local_C`) within the loop, which greatly enhances data reuse:


```c++


template <class AMatrixType, class BMatrixType, class CMatrixType>
void matrix_product_block(double alpha, AMatrixType const& A, BMatrixType const& B, double beta, CMatrixType& C, int BM, int BN, int BK) {
  static_assert(
    AMatrixType::rank() == 2 && BMatrixType::rank() == 2 && CMatrixType::rank() == 2,
    "Views must be of rank 2"
  );
  assert(A.extent(0) == C.extent(0));
  assert(B.extent(1) == C.extent(1));
  assert(A.extent(1) == B.extent(0));

  // Define block sizes (tune these based on the CPU cache)
  ///Default values for BM,BN,BK is 32, defined in the main function

  int BLOCK_I = BM;
  int BLOCK_J = BN;
  int BLOCK_K = BK;

  using execution_space = typename CMatrixType::execution_space;
  using policy_t = Kokkos::MDRangePolicy<
    execution_space,
    Kokkos::Rank<2, Kokkos::Iterate::Default, Kokkos::Iterate::Default>,
    Kokkos::IndexType<int>
  >;

  // Number of blocks in each dimension
  int num_blocks_i = (C.extent(0) + BLOCK_I - 1) / BLOCK_I;
  int num_blocks_j = (C.extent(1) + BLOCK_J - 1) / BLOCK_J;

  Kokkos::parallel_for("dgemm_blocked", policy_t({0, 0}, {num_blocks_i, num_blocks_j}),
  KOKKOS_LAMBDA(const int bi, const int bj) {
    // Define the block boundaries
    const int start_i = bi * BLOCK_I;
    const int end_i = (bi + 1) * BLOCK_I < C.extent(0) ? (bi + 1) * BLOCK_I : C.extent(0);
    const int start_j = bj * BLOCK_J;
    const int end_j = (bj + 1) * BLOCK_J < C.extent(1) ? (bj + 1) * BLOCK_J : C.extent(1);

    // Temporary local storage for the C block
    double local_C[BLOCK_I][BLOCK_J] = {};

    // Initialize local_C with beta * C
    for (int i = start_i; i < end_i; ++i) {
      for (int j = start_j; j < end_j; ++j) {
        local_C[i - start_i][j - start_j] = beta * C(i, j);
      }
    }

    // Loop over K in blocks
    const int num_blocks_k = (A.extent(1) + BLOCK_K - 1) / BLOCK_K;
    for (int bk = 0; bk < num_blocks_k; ++bk) {
      const int start_k = bk * BLOCK_K;
      const int end_k = (bk + 1) * BLOCK_K < A.extent(1) ? (bk + 1) * BLOCK_K : A.extent(1);

      // Compute contribution from this K block
      for (int k = start_k; k < end_k; ++k) {
        for (int i = start_i; i < end_i; ++i) {
          const double a = alpha * A(i, k);
          for (int j = start_j; j < end_j; ++j) {
            local_C[i - start_i][j - start_j] += a * B(k, j);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Write back to global C
    for (int i = start_i; i < end_i; ++i) {
      for (int j = start_j; j < end_j; ++j) {
        C(i, j) = local_C[i - start_i][j - start_j];
      }
    }
  });
}
```

### Performance Analysis Using Perf

The cache-blocked implementation was profiled using `perf` to measure cache performance for matrices of size `1000×1000×1000`. The key performance metrics obtained were:

| Metric                    | Naive Version          | Cache-blocked Version    | Improvement   |
|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Runtime (seconds)**     | `0.3649 s`             | **`0.1397 s`**           | **2.61×**     |
| **Performance (GFLOP/s)** | `5.48 GFLOP/s`         | **`14.31 GFLOP/s`**      | **2.61×**     |
| **L1 Cache Miss Rate**    | `72.27%`               | **`0.55%`**              | **131×**       |
| **LLC (L3) Miss Rate**    | `71.79%`               | **`9.22%`**              | **7.79×**     |




The introduction of the cache-blocked implementation resulted in remarkable performance enhancements:

- **Speedup:** The cache-blocked version achieves a **2.61×** improvement in runtime and performance.
- **Cache Efficiency:** It notably improves L1 and L3 cache efficiency, with L1 miss rates dropping by **131×** and L3 misses by **7.79×**.


### Explanation of Performance Improvements

The observed performance gains and reductions in cache misses are due to the following factors:

1. **Local Buffering for Temporal and Spatial Locality:**
   - **Local Copy:**  
     For each block of `C`, the kernel allocates a small, stack-based two-dimensional array `local_C` of size `BM*BN`). This local array is used to hold the partial results of the block multiplication. Initially, it is loaded with `beta*C`, ensuring that the final update preserves the contribution from the original `C` (scaled by `beta`).
   - **Blocking Over `K`:**  
     Instead of processing the entire `K` dimension at once, the kernel divides `K` into smaller chunks of size `BK`. For each such sub-block, the corresponding sub-tiles of `A` and `B` are used to update `local_C`. Because these updates occur in the fast, on-chip (or register) memory, the data can be reused multiple times with very low latency.
   - **Improved Locality:**  
     By keeping each `BM*BN` block in local memory, the algorithm reduces the number of global memory accesses for `C` during the innermost loops. This leads to fewer L1 cache misses and better spatial locality, as the local array is stored contiguously in memory.

2. **Parallelization via MDRangePolicy:**
   - **2D Tiling:**  
     The kernel uses a 2D MDRangePolicy to divide the work over the `i` and `j` dimensions (the block indices of `C`). Each iteration of the policy handles one block (tile) of `C`. Because these blocks are processed independently, they can be executed in parallel without inter-dependency.
   - **Reduced Synchronization Overhead:**  
     Once the local block computation is complete, the result is written back to the global memory. This design minimizes the need for inter-thread synchronization, as each block's computation is self-contained.
   - **Load Balancing:**  
     Partitioning work in this way provides a natural granularity for parallel execution. However, the number of blocks per matrix (especially for smaller matrices) may limit the scaling. For larger matrices, however, many more blocks are available, which helps in distributing the work evenly among available threads.

3. **Impact on Cache Miss Rates and Performance:**
   - **Spatial Locality:**  
     The contiguous allocation of `local_C` ensures that once a block of data is brought into cache, multiple operations are performed on it, thereby reducing the effective cache miss rate.
   - **Temporal Locality:**  
     Each block is reused across all iterations over the `K` sub-blocks before the final write-back to `C`, which helps to amortize the cost of loading data from main memory.
   - **Overall Throughput:**  
     The experimental results show that, by carefully tuning the block dimensions, significant performance improvements can be achieved (e.g., for the 1000×1000×1000 matrix, a configuration such as 32×32×32 yields a runtime of 0.14 s and 14.3 GFLOP/s compared to far lower throughput for less-optimal configurations).

## Q3 Verification of cache blocked function 
Added a `top.matrix_verify` in `/src` that runs the code sequentially after running with the blocked version, and allows for up to 0.01 relative error. This error stems from the rearragment of the operations performed at compile time and runtime. On average, the error is of about `0.06 %`.

## Q4 Tuning the Block Dimensions for Cache-blocked Matrix Multiplication

The objective of this experiment was to identify the optimal block dimensions (`BM`, `BN`, `BK`) for my cache-blocked matrix multiplication implementation, maximizing computational performance and cache efficiency. Using the Perf profiling tool, I systematically tested multiple configurations to measure runtime, computational performance (GFLOP/s), and cache miss rates (L1 and LLC).

### Experimental Results

The following results were obtained for three different matrix sizes (`500×500×500`, `1000×1000×1000`, and `2000×2000×2000`) using various block configurations, and executed on 8 threads:

### Analysis of Results

- **Optimal Block Size:** 
  - Across all tested matrices, the optimal performance was consistently achieved with a block size of `32×32×32`. For instance, for `2000×2000×2000`, this block size yielded the lowest runtime (**1.3134s**) and highest performance (**12.20 GFLOP/s**).
  
- **Cache Efficiency:**
  - The configuration `32×32×32` not only achieved high computational performance but also substantially reduced L1 cache misses. For instance, for the `1000×1000×1000` matrix, the L1 miss rate was reduced to **0.65%**, highlighting excellent spatial locality.
  - LLC misses, while not always lowest at this block size, were still acceptably low, showing that this configuration maintains excellent temporal locality. The increased LLC misses at larger matrices (`2000×2000×2000`) indicate that even optimal block sizes cannot completely eliminate capacity misses in very large problems, but performance remained optimal despite that.

- **Performance Degradation at Large Block Sizes:** 
  - Very large block sizes, like `64×64×64`, showed substantial performance drops, likely due to cache conflicts and capacity misses. L1 miss rates jumped significantly (around **4.07%**) for the largest matrix, clearly demonstrating why excessively large blocks do not fit well into the cache hierarchy.

### Perf Tool Validation
Perf validated the effectiveness of the optimized cache-blocking strategy:

- L1 cache miss rate drastically reduced to less than **1%** for optimal blocks (`32×32×32`), significantly improving spatial locality.
- LLC cache miss rate was also significantly lowered compared to non-optimized versions, demonstrating strong temporal locality improvement.

### Conclusion of the Cache-blocking Study

Through systematic testing of various block dimensions and profiling with Perf, I determined that the optimal block size (`32×32×32`) maximized computational performance and cache utilization for the tested matrices. This block configuration provided the best balance between cache fitting and computational overhead, resulting in high GFLOP/s performance and minimal cache misses. 

These results confirm that careful tuning of cache-blocking dimensions significantly enhances spatial and temporal locality, directly leading to superior computational performance.

## Q5 Final strong scaling study

## Analysis & Discussion

In the revised kernel, the global matrix multiplication is decomposed into smaller, independent blocks using Kokkos’s MDRangePolicy. The output matrix \(C\) is divided into tiles of dimensions `BM*BN`, where each tile is processed by a single MDRangePolicy iteration over the block indices. Within each block, the following steps occur:

1. **Local Buffering for Temporal and Spatial Locality:**
   - **Local Copy:**  
     For each block of \(C\), the kernel allocates a small, stack-based two-dimensional array `local_C` of size \(BM \times BN\). This local array is used to hold the partial results of the block multiplication. Initially, it is loaded with \(\beta \times C\), ensuring that the final update preserves the contribution from the original \(C\) (scaled by \(\beta\)).
   - **Blocking Over \(K\):**  
     Instead of processing the entire \(K\) dimension at once, the kernel divides \(K\) into smaller chunks of size \(BK\). For each such sub-block, the corresponding sub-tiles of \(A\) and \(B\) are used to update `local_C`. Because these updates occur in the fast, on-chip (or register) memory, the data can be reused multiple times with very low latency.
   - **Improved Locality:**  
     By keeping each \(BM \times BN\) block in local memory, the algorithm reduces the number of global memory accesses for \(C\) during the innermost loops. This leads to fewer L1 cache misses and better spatial locality, as the local array is stored contiguously in memory.

2. **Parallelization via MDRangePolicy:**
   - **2D Tiling:**  
     The kernel uses a 2D MDRangePolicy to divide the work over the \(i\) and \(j\) dimensions (the block indices of \(C\)). Each iteration of the policy handles one block (tile) of \(C\). Because these blocks are processed independently, they can be executed in parallel without inter-dependency.
   - **Reduced Synchronization Overhead:**  
     Once the local block computation is complete, the result is written back to the global memory. This design minimizes the need for inter-thread synchronization, as each block's computation is self-contained.
   - **Load Balancing:**  
     Partitioning work in this way provides a natural granularity for parallel execution. However, the number of blocks per matrix (especially for smaller matrices) may limit the scaling. For larger matrices, however, many more blocks are available, which helps in distributing the work evenly among available threads.

3. **Impact on Cache Miss Rates and Performance:**
   - **Spatial Locality:**  
     The contiguous allocation of `local_C` ensures that once a block of data is brought into cache, multiple operations are performed on it, thereby reducing the effective cache miss rate.
   - **Temporal Locality:**  
     Each block is reused across all iterations over the \(K\) sub-blocks before the final write-back to \(C\), which helps to amortize the cost of loading data from main memory.
   - **Overall Throughput:**  
     The experimental results show that, by carefully tuning the block dimensions, significant performance improvements can be achieved (e.g., for the 1000×1000×1000 matrix, a configuration such as 32×32×32 yields a runtime of 0.485 s and 4.13 GFLOP/s compared to far lower throughput for less-optimal configurations).

---


In summary, tuning the block dimensions in a cache-blocked matrix multiplication kernel can dramatically improve performance. By carefully choosing parameters that fit the processor’s cache hierarchy and by employing strategies (such as local buffering and MDRangePolicy-based tiling) to maximize data reuse, the performance—measured in GFLOP/s and runtime—can be significantly enhanced. Future work might explore dynamic tuning, further increasing the level of parallelism (e.g., using nested policies), or leveraging scratch memory for additional improvements.

### Conclusion

The revised kernel, which partitions the global matrix multiplication into blocks using Kokkos's MDRangePolicy and employs local buffering for each \( C \) block, shows considerable performance improvements. Based on our experiments:

- **Optimal Block Configuration:**  
  For all tested matrix sizes, the **32×32×32 configuration** consistently yields the highest GFLOP/s and lowest runtime in the medium and large cases. For the smallest problem, the performance differences are less pronounced given the small absolute runtime values.

- **Cache Locality Improvements:**  
  The use of local buffering significantly reduces L1 cache misses (with rates as low as 0.40%–0.45% for the 32×32×32 configuration), which translates into better temporal and spatial data reuse. Although LLC miss rates are higher in some cases, the overall performance gain suggests that the kernel is effectively leveraging on-chip memory and registers.

- **Strong Scaling and Concurrency:**  
  Our final strong scaling study indicates that, under the current design and with 8 available threads, additional threading does not further reduce runtime. This is expected for a memory-bound kernel where increasing concurrency beyond a certain point only increases contention on memory bandwidth.

In summary, by tuning the block dimensions and redesigning the kernel with local buffering and a 2D MDRangePolicy, we have maximized performance for this cache-blocked matrix multiplication. The 32×32×32 configuration demonstrates the best trade-off between computational throughput and cache efficiency, confirming the importance of carefully balancing block size to align with the processor’s cache hierarchy.


This comprehensive analysis confirms that using the 32×32×32 block configuration maximizes performance by optimally balancing computation and memory reuse, even though the kernel becomes memory-bound, which limits the benefits of adding more threads. Future improvements may involve exploring nested parallelism or using scratch memory to further reduce cache misses.

### Q5: Final strong scaling and performance analysis 
## Final Performance and Strong Scaling Study

### Methodology

In this final performance and strong scaling study, I used the optimized cache-blocked matrix multiplication implementation previously developed. Specifically, the best-performing block dimensions `(32, 32, 32)` identified in earlier cache-blocking studies were selected. The goal of this test was to assess performance scalability across multiple CPU threads (1, 2, 4, and 8 threads) and three different problem sizes (`500×500×500`, `1000×1000×1000`, and `2000×2000×2000`).

For each combination of thread count and matrix size, the benchmark was repeated five times, taking the average runtime and calculating standard deviations. The performance metric used is floating-point operations per second (GFLOP/s), derived from runtime measurements. OpenMP environment variables were configured (`OMP_NUM_THREADS`, `OMP_PROC_BIND`, and `OMP_PLACES`) to ensure optimal and consistent thread binding. Additionally, a brief pause (2.5s) between runs minimized resource contention and enhanced measurement accuracy.

### Experimental Results

The summarized results from this strong scaling experiment are presented below:

### Analysis and Discussion

From the above results, clear insights regarding strong scaling and performance are evident:

**1. Performance and Scalability**:

- **Single-thread Baseline**: At single-thread execution, all matrix sizes exhibited nearly identical GFLOP/s (approximately 4.48 to 4.49 GFLOP/s). This demonstrates that computational efficiency remains stable across problem sizes in the absence of parallel overhead.

- **Scalability up to 4 Threads**: When increasing from 1 to 2 threads, performance improved significantly for all matrix sizes, nearly doubling the GFLOP/s and halving runtime—indicating near-ideal scaling. Moving from 2 to 4 threads maintained this excellent scalability, again approximately doubling performance:
  - For example, the `1000×1000×1000` case showed 1 thread at 4.48 GFLOP/s, increasing to 15.73 GFLOP/s with 4 threads, achieving an impressive 3.5× speedup over single-thread execution.
  
- **Performance Drop at 8 Threads**: Interestingly, increasing from 4 to 8 threads caused performance degradation in all tested cases:
  - For `500×500×500`, performance dropped from 16.56 GFLOP/s (4 threads) to 14.51 GFLOP/s (8 threads).
  - For `1000×1000×1000`, it decreased from 15.73 GFLOP/s (4 threads) to 14.00 GFLOP/s (8 threads).
  - For `2000×2000×2000`, it decreased from 12.78 GFLOP/s (4 threads) to 12.17 GFLOP/s (8 threads).

This deviation from ideal scaling is likely due to the overhead and contention issues introduced by utilizing hyper-threading. My CPU has 4 physical cores and 8 threads (hyper-threaded). Beyond 4 threads, the processor's physical resources (execution units, cache, memory bandwidth) become saturated, causing increased contention and cache interference, and thus performance degradation compared to ideal linear scaling.

**2. Optimal Matrix Size for Scalability**:

- The intermediate-sized matrix (`1000×1000×1000`) showed the most balanced scalability, with a clear performance peak at 4 threads (15.73 GFLOP/s).
- The smaller matrix (`500×500×500`) exhibited exceptional initial scalability but was also significantly affected by overhead at 8 threads, possibly due to the limited amount of computational work relative to parallel overhead.
- The largest matrix (`2000×2000×2000`) showed stable but less dramatic scalability due to the increased impact of memory and cache limitations, demonstrating sustained but diminished returns beyond 4 threads.

**3. Impact of Cache-blocking**:

The optimized block size (`32×32×32`) demonstrated substantial improvement over the naive (unblocked) approach tested previously, with significantly reduced runtime and enhanced computational efficiency. Cache blocking improved spatial and temporal data locality, significantly reducing cache misses, especially at L1, directly boosting performance and scalability.

### Conclusion

Through rigorous experimentation and systematic tuning, the optimized cache-blocked matrix multiplication code achieved remarkable computational efficiency and excellent scalability up to the number of physical CPU cores (4 cores on my system). However, utilizing hyper-threaded virtual cores (beyond 4 threads) led to diminishing returns and slight performance regressions due to resource contention and parallel overhead.

This comprehensive strong scaling study highlights the critical importance of optimal thread management and careful consideration of processor architecture (physical vs. logical cores) when scaling parallelized algorithms. Cache-blocked optimization proved highly effective, drastically increasing performance relative to the naive approach, and the block size configuration (`32×32×32`) emerged as particularly well-suited for my CPU architecture.
